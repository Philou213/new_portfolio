## Game Overview  
**Recursive Conflict** is an arcade-style game where the player must capture a box and escape with it. After each victory, a clone replays all of your past actions and also tries to win. Each success makes the game progressively harder — you are essentially competing against yourself.

## Project Context  
This game was developed during the **GMTK Game Jam 2025**.

## My Role
I worked entirely solo on the project.

## Tools  
This game was developed using **Godot 4**.
