## Game Overview  
**Re:Play** is a platformer where the player must follow the same path as the previous character. However, the previous character cheats, forcing the player to use “video editing magic” by pausing certain actions at precise moments.

## Project Context  
This game was developed during **Micro Jam 15: Ghost**.

## Tools  
This game was developed using **Unity**.

## My Role
I worked on the player character and its movement mechanics, including running, jumping, and wall-jumping.
